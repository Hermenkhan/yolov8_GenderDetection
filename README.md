# Gender Detection with YOLOv8 and VGG19

This project integrates YOLOv8 for object detection with VGG19 for gender classification. The primary focus is on detecting persons in images or videos and classifying their gender using a VGG19 model.

## Project Structure

- **deep_sort/**: Contains the implementation of the DeepSORT algorithm for tracking detected persons across frames.
- **runs/**: Stores the results and outputs generated by the detection and tracking processes.
- **Scripts/**: Directory for custom scripts used in the project.
- **share/**: Contains shared resources necessary for the project's execution.
- **precision and recall.py**: Script for computing precision and recall metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **pyvenv.cfg**: Configuration file for the project's Python virtual environment.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.
- **track_count_persons.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for performing person detection, tracking, and gender classification using YOLOv8 and VGG19.
- **track_count_persons.py**: Python script for person detection, tracking, and gender classification.
- **work.py**: Main script to execute the detection, tracking, and classification pipeline.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: YOLOv8 is utilized to identify persons in the provided input.
2. **Tracking**: DeepSORT algorithm tracks the identified persons across multiple frames to maintain their unique identities.
3. **Gender Classification**: Detected persons' images are processed through a VGG19 model to determine their gender.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file before running the scripts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `work.py` script or explore the functionalities through the `track_count_persons.ipynb` notebook.
